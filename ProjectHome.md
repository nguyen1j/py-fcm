fcm is a python library for interacting with flow cytometry data and performing statistical analysis of flow data, in an easy and consistent manner.
the goals of fcm are to be:

  * Simple
    * uses sensible defaults
    * has a consisten api
    * delivers convenience functions where apropreate
    * "Pythonic"
  * Efficent
    * uses fast code and algorithms provided by others (ie, numpy and scipy)
    * optimizes slow parts with extensions in C/C++/(optionally Cuda) where appropriate



Currently the library is under active development.  If you would like to help in the development or have questions about the goals or aims of the project, please contact jacob dot frelinger at duke dot edu.
